  <p>Many politicians and citizens of India believe that Indian healthcare is developing at a very promising rate considering the country is the second most populated country and is in the line to be the most populated country in the world according to the experts. This leads to a rising need for a good and efficient healthcare system in the country. By considering the demography of the country the results are not as promising as it seems to be.<br><br>
According to many mutual funds and many financial institutions they estimate that the Indian healthcare industry is around 372 Billion USD in 2022 and is seen to have grown 22% annually which leads to very promising results still India is only in the top 10 biggest healthcare in the world which leaves with a lot of growth in future, India is also found to be the 3rd largest medicine producer in the world which shows that the country has a lot of surplus of drugs and has capability to fulfill all the demands of drugs which is there in the country.<br><br>
There has been many technological develoment which is seen in the Indian healthcare indsutry like the increase in number of MRI machines, vaccination centers, R and D centers and more. Even the governmnetal hospitals which are condered by many indians as unhygeneric and unmanaged has seen many imporvements in the pst decades which increases hope that in future the indian healthcare can surely improve and come to the top, But this is this a tip of the ice berg.<br>

  <p>The budget the ministry of finance anounced this year was of a size of 39 lakh crores which is by  far the biggest budget the government has anounced. In the budget of 39 lakh crores the following chart was made by the indian government but there was no inclusion of healthcare in thsi graph The reasons for this was because the spending of healthcare this year was about 86 throusand crores which is only 0.22% of the total budget which means the speanding is exteremly low. On the other hand healthcare spending of India is so less that the conditions of the healthcare is so poor and this gave India a score of 66 in GHS index (Global Health Security Index) out of 195 Nations.<br><br>
    The doctor to patient ratioin India is somehwere about 1.34:1000 people and the recommanded doctor to patient index accoding to the WHO is about 3:1000 which means the country even lack the amount of medicl workers to handle the rising population.

  <h2 style="font-family:roboto;font-size:25px;text-align:center;">Interpretation and conclusion</h2>
  <p style="font-size:14px;text-align:left;padding:5px 15px">There is even more, experts believe that many of the doctors in the country are coming because of government reservations in the medical colleges meaning there are very high numbers of doctors which are not as qualified as other doctors. Many people create fake doctor certificates to treat people as seen in one of my sources which means the ratio 1.34:1000 might not even be correct! 75% of the medical infrastructure in the country is only situated in the urban areas where about 27% of the population only live means that most of the Indians are not getting proper healthcare. The quality of healthcare is so bad in India in many hospitals in fact that they use the same syringe to give drugs to many people which increases the chances of HIV and other infections. THere is availability of proper supplies and no proper cleanliness is there too. About 1 doctor is available for 10000 people in rural India so now do you think that the condition of the healthcare is good? There is no proper management or sanitization used there and sometimes not even proper supply of clean water which instead of testing one person can make them even more sicker. The hospitals In rural areas don't even have the health equipment or knowledge to do a proper open surgery or operation if required.<br>
  People prefer private hospitals because of this, the fees of those hospitals are in lakhs which is mostly not even affordable by people and in fact only 3-4% of Indians can afford such health services which means there is a total trouble because the PCI of the country is about 1.27 Lakhs excluding expenses.
