      <h2 style="text-align:center">Solutions for making the healthcare more proper</h2>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p style="padding:5px 10px"><b>Amandment 1 - </b>First is that accoding to the constiution ofindia giving reserrvations is compelsary for any governmental instutiton because
    of which giving 27% reservation in public medical colleges is nesessary which is not ethical if we try to be more international minded. The amendment which I want
to make in this is that I want to reduce the reservation from 27% in the medical colleges to about 5%. This is a normal change but this will increase the supply of some
quality doctors in the society.<br><br><b>Amendment 2 - </b>One more is that the expenditure of the government given to the healthcare ministry in India was about 86000 Cr
which was 0.2% of the total budget which was very less so to make a change in this the government should increase the money allocation given to the ministry of health to
above 1% and in terms of the gdp share also the government should spend more than 5% in healthcare. The changes I mentained is still far less comapred to other developed Nations
still these changes will increase the healthcare budget of the government by tripling it which can be really helpful in imporving infrastructure in rural India and training
fake doctors to do better.</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li>Building more medical colleges for more medical graduates so that the doctor to patient ratio can be improved in India and specially in rural parts of the 
        country.
    </li>
    <li>Building more hospitals and clinics in rural India for better reach of healthcare to the roots of the country.</li>
    <li>Proper inspections of the govenmental hospitals often to ensure proper quality and management.</li>
    <li>Spreading awareness about ways to stay healthy and hygeneric in rural parts of the country.</li>
    <li>Focus on developing primary care instead of focusing on secondary or tirtiary care.</li>
    <li>Economic development in the country.</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Effects of implimenting the solution</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Developing the healthcare of any country can have really benefitual effects on all the stake holders like the government, Patients, Doctors, Companies.
        The main reason of this is that if the following solutions are implimented properly then they will surely develop the healthcare of the country and doing so will
        increase the life expectancy of the country. Other effects are as shwon below - <br>
        <b>Social and Ethical - </b> The increase in life expectancy and decrease in the deaths from diseases will be really good for the society because people will be able to
        live their lives properly with healthcare not as a privilage but as a right. It will be ethically good for the government and the society to take such step because
        every human deserves to get healthcare treatment and it will be the right way to use the taxpayer money for the development of the people.<br>
        <b>Economical - </b>With the dveeloopment in healthcare the number of hospitals will increase will will surely increase the employeement in the healthcare Sector
        of the country and apart from that with the rise in drug demand the drug companies will also hire more poeple which will lead to economcial development. With better
        treatment people will be able to work more properly and efficiently which again will benefit the economy.<br>
        <b>Environmental - </b> Evene throough the healthcare will develop because of which the lif eexpectancy will also grow and because of this the population of India
        which is already increasing will increase even more because of which there will be more need of crops and resources so more pollution can also increase whcih can cause
        a domino effect of more problems. Manufacturing of more medicines and drugs will also lead to a lot of toxic waste create and environmental damage which is an 
        opportunity cost for better healthcare.<br>
        <b>Political - </b>because of better healthcare in the country the respect of the government will also increase in other countrys and also people will gain more 
        trust and respect towards the government which led to thsi revolutionary channge.
